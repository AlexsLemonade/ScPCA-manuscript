## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The Single-cell Pediatric Cancer Atlas (ScPCA) Portal (<https://scpca.alexslemonade.org/>) is a data resource for uniformly processed single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data and de-identified metadata from pediatric tumor samples.
Originally comprised of data from 10 projects funded by Alexâ€™s Lemonade Stand Foundation (ALSF), the Portal currently contains summarized gene expression data for over 700 samples across 55 cancer types from ALSF-funded and community-contributed datasets.
Downloads include gene expression data as `SingleCellExperiment` or `AnnData` objects containing raw and normalized counts, PCA and UMAP coordinates, automated cell type annotations, and summary reports.
Some samples have additional data from bulk RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and/or feature barcoding (e.g., CITE-seq and cell hashing) included in the download.
All data on the Portal were uniformly processed using `scpca-nf`, an open-source and efficient Nextflow workflow that uses `alevin-fry` to quantify gene expression.
Comprehensive documentation, including descriptions of file contents and a guide to getting started, is available at <https://scpca.readthedocs.io>.
