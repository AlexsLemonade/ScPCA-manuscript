## The Single-cell Pediatric Cancer Atlas Portal

1. History and overview of the Portal
  - In 2022, the Childhood Cancer Data Lab launched the Single-cell Pediatric Cancer Atlas (ScPCA) Portal to make uniformly processed, summarized single-cell and single-nuclei RNA-seq data and de-identified metadata available for download
  - The Portal currently holds X amount of samples from X amount of tumor types
  - Data available on the Portal was obtained using two mechanisms - accepting raw data from ALSF-funded investigators and investigators who used our open-source pipeline to produce summarized gene expression data for inclusion on the portal.
  - In addition to providing summarized gene expression data, we collect a core set of metadata that is provided on the Portal for all samples including, age, sex, diagnosis, subdiagnosis (if applicable), tissue location, and disease stage.
  - Fig. 1A shows how many samples we have from each type of tumor. For each diagnosis, we also indicate what proportion of the samples come from each disease stage (e.g., initial diagnosis, recurrence, post-mortem).
  - The samples obtained on the portal are mostly from patient tumors, although some are from patient-derived xenografts and human cell lines
  - In addition to single-cell and single-nuclei RNA-seq, many samples have associated bulk RNA-seq, ADT data (CITE-seq), cell hashing, or spatial transcriptomics.
  - Fig. 1B summarizes the total number of samples that are single-cell vs. single-nuclei. Additionally, we show how many of the samples on the portal also have either bulk, CITE, cell hashing, or spatial data.
  - Supplemental Table 1 shows a breakdown of how many of each modality is found in each project.

2. Obtaining additional project information
  - On the Portal, samples are organized by project. Each project is a collection of similar samples from a single investigator.
  - To select projects of interest, users can filter based on diagnosis, modality included, single-cell or single-nuclei and 10X version. Additionally, users will be able to filter based on if the project includes cell line samples or xenografts.
  - A summary of each project, including a list of samples found in each project, is displayed on the Portal.
  - Fig.1C shows an example of this summary which include an abstract, links to any external information about the projects such as any associated publication information, and links to external places where data may be stored such as SRA or GEO.
  - If a project includes bulk, CITE, spatial, or multiplexing, this will also be indicated on the project card.
