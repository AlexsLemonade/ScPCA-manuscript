## The Single-cell Pediatric Cancer Atlas Portal

In March of 2022, the Childhood Cancer Data Lab launched the Single-cell Pediatric Cancer Atlas (ScPCA) Portal to make uniformly processed, summarized single-cell and single-nuclei RNA-seq data and de-identified metadata from pediatric tumor samples available for download.
Data available on the Portal was obtained using two different mechanisms: raw data was accepted from ALSF-funded investigators and processed using our open-source pipeline, `scpca-nf`, or investigators processed their raw data using `scpca-nf` and submitted the output for inclusion on the Portal.

All samples on the Portal include a core set of metadata obtained from investigators, including age, sex, diagnosis, subdiagnosis (if applicable), tissue location, and disease stage.
Some investigators submitted additional metadata, such as treatment and tumor stage, which can also be found on the Portal.
All submitted metadata was standardized to maintain consistency across projects before adding to the Portal.
In addition to providing a human-readable value for the submitted metadata, we also provide an ontology term ID, if applicable.
Submitted metadata was mapped to an associated ontology term IDs obtained from HsapDV (age) [@url:https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/hsapdv], PATO (sex)[@url:https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/pato], NCBI taxonomy (organism)[@url:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy], MONDO (disease)[@url:https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/mondo], UBERON (tissue)[@url:https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/uberon], and Hancestro (ethnicity, if applicable) [@url:https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/hancestro]. 
Including ontology term IDs for each sample provides users with standardized metadata terms that can be used across all projects.

The Portal contains data from 500 samples and over 50 tumor types.
<!-- TODO: Update numbers -->
The total number of samples for each diagnosis is shown in Figure 1A, along with a breakdown of the proportion of samples from each disease stage within a diagnosis group.
Figure 1A summarizes all samples from patient tumors or patient-derived xenografts currently available on the Portal.
Most samples found on the Portal were obtained from patients with leukemia (n = 192). 
The Portal also includes samples from brain and central nervous system tumors (n = 154), sarcoma and soft tissue tumors (n = 68), and a variety of other solid tumors (n = 87). 
Most samples were collected at initial diagnosis (n = 424), with a smaller number of samples collected either at recurrence (n = 64), during progressive disease (n = 10), or post-mortem (n = 2). 
Along with the patient tumors, the Portal contains a small number of human tumor cell line samples (n = 4).


Each of the available samples contains summarized gene expression data from either single-cell or single-nuclei RNA sequencing. 
However, some samples also include additional data, such as quantified expression data from tagging cells with Antibody-derived tags (ADT), like CITE-seq antibodies [@doi:10.1038/nmeth.4380], or multiplexing samples with hashtag oligonucleotides (HTO)[@doi:10.1186/s13059-018-1603-1] prior to sequencing. 
Out of the 500 samples, 96 have associated CITE-seq data, and 19 have associated multiplexing data. 
In some cases, multiple libraries from the same sample were collected for additional sequencing, either for bulk RNA-seq or spatial transcriptomics. 
Specifically, 118 samples on the Portal were sequenced using bulk RNA-seq and 94 samples were sequenced using spatial transcriptomics.
A summary of the number of samples with each additional modality is shown in Figure 1B, and a detailed summary of the total samples with each sequencing method broken down by project is available in Supplemental Table 1.

Samples on the Portal are organized by project, where each project is a collection of similar samples from an individual lab.
Users can filter projects based on diagnosis, included modalities (e.g., CITE-seq, bulk RNA-seq), 10X Genomics version (e.g., 10Xv2, 10Xv3), and whether or not a project includes samples derived from patient-derived xenografts or cell lines.
The project card displays an abstract, the total number of samples included, a list of diagnoses for all samples included in the Project, and links to any external information associated with the project, such as publications and links to external data, such as SRA or GEO (Figure 1C).
The project card will also indicate the type(s) of sequencing performed, including the 10X Genomics kit version, the suspension type (cell or nucleus), and if additional sequencing is present, like bulk RNA-seq or multiplexing.

## Uniform processing of data available on the ScPCA Portal

1. Processing data with scpca-nf and alevin-fry
  - All data available on the portal was uniformly processed using scpca-nf, an open-source and efficient Nextflow workflow for quantifying single-cell and single-nuclei RNA-seq data.
  - The workflow uses `salmon alevin` and `alevin-fry` to quantify gene expression data and outputs both raw and normalized counts stored as `SingleCellExperiment` and `AnnData` objects.
  - In building the workflow we sought to look for a tool that was fast and memory efficient with comparable results to other popular tools, like `Cell Ranger`.
  - Reads are aligned using the selective alignment option of `salmon alevin` to an index with transcripts corresponding to spliced cDNA and intronic regions, denoted by `alevin-fry` as a `splici` index.
  - We compared quantification of single-cell and single-nuclei samples with `alevin-fry` and `Cell Ranger` and observed a decrease in both run time and memory usage in `alevin-fry` compared to `Cell Ranger` (FigS1A).
  - When comparing the total UMIs per cell, total genes detected per cell, and mean gene expression, there was no observable difference between `alevin-fry` and `Cell Ranger` (FigS1B-D).
  - By utilizing `alevin-fry` in the `scpca-nf` workflow we can process multiple samples at a fraction of the time and cost.

2. Post-processing of quantified gene expression data (Fig 2A)
  - In addition to quantification of gene expression, `scpca-nf` also performs filtering, normalization, dimensionality reduction, and cell type annotation.
  - The output from  `alevin-fry` includes a gene by cell count matrix for all barcodes identified, even those that may not contain true cells. This matrix is stored in a `SingleCellExperiment` and output from the workflow as an `_unfiltered.rds` file.
  - The unfiltered gene by cell counts matrices are then filtered using `DropletUtils::emptyDropsCellRanger()` to remove any barcodes that are not likely to contain cells. All cells that pass this filtering are saved to a filtered `SingleCellExperiment` object and `_filtered.rds` file.
  - This filtered object is used as input to the post-processing part of the workflow. This includes removal of low-quality cells using `miQC`, normalization, and dimensionality reduction. The final step of the post-processing performed in `scpca-nf` is classification of cell types using automated methods, `SingleR` and `CellAssign`. The results from this analysis are stored in a processed object saved to a `processed.rds`.
  - By providing all three files, unfiltered, filtered, and processed this allows users to perform their own filtering and normalization or to skip those steps and use the already processed objects.
  - Finally, all `SingleCellExperiment` objects saved as `.rds` files are converted to `AnnData` objects and saved as `.hdf5` files to allow for downstream processing in either R or Python.
  - On the Portal, users can choose to download data as either `SingleCellExperiment` or `AnnData` objects and all downloads will contain all three objects output from `scpca-nf`, the unfiltered, filtered, and processed objects (do we include the download illustrations in the figure to display this?)

3. QC report (Fig 2B)
  - Along with outputting the uniformly processed data files, `scpca-nf` also includes a step to create a quality control report for each library.
  - This report includes a summary of processing information and library statistics, e.g., the total number of mapped reads, total number of cells, and relevant versions of tools used within the workflow like `salmon` and `alevin-fry`.
  - Each report also includes summarized plots showing the quality of each library.
  - The knee plot shown in the report ranks the total number of UMIs in each droplet and indicates cells that remained after filtering out empty droplets.
  - For each cell that passes filtering out empty droplets, the number of total UMIs, genes detected, and mitochondrial reads is calculated. These cell metrics are summarized in a single plot.
  - To remove low-quality cells from the counts matrices, `scpca-nf` applies `miQC`, a data driven approach to filtering cells. The `miQC` model and a plot showing which cells are kept and removed when filtering with `miQC` are shown in the QC report.
  - Finally, remaining cells are normalized and undergo dimensionality reduction. The QC report includes a single UMAP where cells are colored by the total number of genes detected and a faceted UMAP where cells are colored by the expression of a top highly variable gene.

4. Benefits of scpca-nf/ Nextflow allows for reproducibility and portability (Does this fit here or should it be earlier before describing the workflow?)
  - Using Nextflow as the backbone for the `scpca-nf` workflow ensures reproducibility and portability for users on other systems.
  - The scpca-nf workflow can be run in almost any environment including slurm, torque, AWS batch, etc (https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/executor.html). This allows users to run this workflow in the environment that they are comfortable in with minimal set-up of dependencies.
  - Nextflow handles all dependencies automatically and set up generally requires only organizing input files and configuring Nextflow to run in your environment.
  - Each process in the workflow is run in a docker container, so users only need to install Nextflow and docker to be able to use this workflow.
  - Nextflow also handles parallelizing processing based on your environment and will configure processing so that run time is minimal.

## Making samples with additional modalities available on the Portal

1. Processing samples with additional modalities
  - In addition to samples that have single-cell and single-nuclei RNA-seq, we also received samples from submitters with additional sequencing modalities, including CITE-seq, cell hashing, spatial transcriptomics, and bulk RNA-seq.
  - To make all the data that we received available, we included additional modules in `scpca-nf` that would accommodate these additional sequencing modalities.
  - For a full summary of the libraries and samples available with additional modalities, see supplemental Table 1.
  - `scpca-nf` is capable of processing samples that are from a mix of sample types. This means that libraries with and without ADT data or any of the modalities discussed here can be processed together in a single run. Nextflow will handle the parallel processing such that each sample type is run through the correct processes for that modality type.

2. CITE-seq (Fig. S2A-B)
  - For all libraries with associated ADT or CITE-seq data, we provide both the RNA and ADT gene expression data in the files available for download on the portal.
  - Both FASTQ from single-cell/single-nuclei and from ADT were input into `scpca-nf` and quantified using `salmon alevin` and `alevin-fry`.
  - We required a barcodes file from each submitter that contained the ADT labels and the associated barcode. This was used to build the index used for quantification of the ADT FASTQ and creation of the cell by ADT matrix.
  - Unlike with RNA counts, we do not perform any filtering of cells due to low quality ADT expression. However, we do include the results from running `DropletUtils::cleanTagCounts()` in both the filtered and processed objects produced by `scpca-nf`.
  - Similar to RNA counts, we do normalize ADT data and provide the normalized counts matrix in the processed SCE object, but we do not provide any dimensionality reduction of ADT data, only the RNA data is used for dimensionality reduction.
  - ADT data can be found in the `altExp` slot of each `SingleCellExperiment` object or as a separate `_adt.hdf5` file for `AnnData` objects.
  - This section includes a summary of statistics such as how many cells express each ADT.
  - For libraries with ADT, we also include additional plots.
  - As mentioned above, we include the results from `DropletUtils::cleanTagCounts()`, but do not filter any ADTs or cells from the object. Instead we include a column in the `colData` of the processed SCE object that indicates if it is recommended to remove ADTs or not. In the QC report, we summarize filtering taking into account removal of cells because of low quality RNA or ADT. The plot shown in the report highlights which cells would be removed if only filtering using RNA, only ADT, or both.
  - Similar to the UMAPs for the RNA data from single-cell/single-nuclei that highlight the top variable genes, the report includes UMAPs highlighing the 4 most variable ADTs in the data. This is shown with UMAPs and ridge plots.

3. Cell hashing (Fig. S2C)
  - Similar to ADT data, if any libraries were multiplexed and have an associated cell hashing library, both the RNA and HTO FASTQ are provided as input to the workflow and quantified with `salmon alevin` and `alevin-fry`. We also include a library pools file which indicates which libraries contain which samples and the associated tags used to label each sample.
  - Although we quantify the HTO data and include the cell by HTO counts matrix in all objects, we do not demultiplex the samples so that there is one sample per library. Instead, we apply multiple demultiplexing methods including genetic demultiplexing, demultiplexing with `DropletUtils::hashedDrops()`, and demultipilexing with `Seurat::HTODemux()`. The results from these three methods are included in the filtered and processed objects.
  - Add some more details about how we do genetic demultiplexing, using vireo and bulk RNA-seq
  - If a library has associated HTO data, an additional section is added to the QC report included on the portal and output by `scpca-nf`.
  - This section includes a summary of statistics such as how many cells express each HTO.
  - For HTO, we do not include any additional plots, but we do show a table summarizing how many cells belong to each sample included in the multiplexed library using each of the demultiplexing methods mentioned.

4. Bulk and Spatial (Fig S3)
  - Some samples underwent sequencing using both single-cell/single-nuclei and an additional method like bulk RNA-seq or spatial transcriptomics.
  - `scpca-nf` is able to quantify both of these additional sequencing methods.
  - Bulk RNA FASTQ are first trimmed using `fastp` and then aligned using `salmon`. The bulk output is a single tsv file with the sample by gene matrix for all samples in that project.
  - For spatial transcriptomics, the spatial RNA FASTQ and slide image are input into `scpca-nf` and quantified using `spaceranger`. The output includes the spot by gene matrix along with a summary report, produced by `spaceranger`.

## Downloading projects from the ScPCA Portal

1. Users can download all samples for a given project together
  - The portal has two different options to allow users to download data for all samples in a given ScPCA Project, either as invididual files for each sample or as a single merged file.
  - By default, when downloading a project, the download will include a folder for each sample that is included in the project.
  - That folder will contain all individual `SingleCellExperiment` objects as `.rds` files or `AnnData` objects as `.hdf5` files, depending on the file format chosen by the user (Fig. 3A).
  - Each of these objects contains the gene expression data and metadata for a single library.
  - If a given project has associated bulk RNA-seq, then a sample by gene counts matrix, `bulk_quant.tsv`, including the quantified gene expression data for all samples in a project with associated bulk RNA-seq will be included.
2. Merged objects
  - Providing all data from all libraries withing a single file makes it easier for users to perform joint analysis on multiple samples at the same time. 
  Specifically, these objects can be useful for comparing gene-level metrics across multiple samples, such as differential expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis.
  - Therefore, we make a single, merged `SingleCellExperiment` or `AnnData` object (Fig. 3B) available for each project (without batch-correction or integration).
  - This file contains one object with all raw and normalized gene expression data and metadata for all single-cell and single-nuclei RNA-seq libraries within a given ScPCA project
  - If downloading a project that contains at least one library with CITE-seq, the quantified CITE-seq expression data will also be merged. In SCEs this is provided as an `altExp` within the main object, but for `AnnData` objects, the quantified CITE-seq data is provided as a separate file.

2. The merged object workflow (Fig. 3C and 3D)
  - To create the merged objects, we created an additional stand-alone workflow for merging the output from `scpca-nf`, `merge.nf` (Fig. 3C).
  - Following processing of each `SingleCellExperiment` object with `scpca-nf`, all processed objects from all libraries and samples within a project are input to the merge workflow, which combines all input data into a single merged object.
  - The merged object contains raw and normalized gene expression counts for all cells in all libraries. The same index was used for processing all individual libraries, so the genes found will be the same as in an invididual object.
  - After merging, the top 2000 high-variance genes are calculated by modeling variance within each library included in the merged object.
  - These high-variance genes are used to calculate new PCA coordinates using `batchelor::multiBatchPCA()` and specifying librares as batches.
  - The top 50 PCs were selected and used as input to calculate new UMAP embeddings on the merged object.
  - Similar to `scpca-nf`, the merged `SingleCellExperiment` object is converted to a merged `AnnData` object and both formats are provided as download options on the Portal.
  - Along with the merged objects, for each project, a merged summary report is created and output.
  - This report includes a brief summary of the samples and libraries included in the merged object, including a summary of the type of libraries (e.g., single-cell, single-nuclei, with CITE-seq) and sample diagnoses included in the object.
  - The report also contains a UMAP showing all cells from all libraries included in the merged object. For each library, a separate panel is shown, and cells from that library are colored while all other cells are gray (Fig. 3D).
