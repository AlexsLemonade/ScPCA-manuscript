A. Barplots showing sample counts across four main cancer groupings in the ScPCA Portal, with each bar displaying the number of samples for each cancer type.
Each bar is colored based on the number of samples with the indicated disease timing, and total sample counts for each cancer type are shown to the right of each bar.

B. Barplot showing sample counts across types of modalities present in the ScPCA Portal.
All samples in the Portal are shown under the "All Samples" heading.
Samples under the "Samples with additional modalities" heading represent a subset of the total samples with the given additional modality.
Colors shown for each additional modality indicate the suspension type used, either single-cell or single-nuclei RNA-seq.
For example, 75 single-cell samples and 101 single-nuclei samples have accompanying bulk RNA-seq data.
Two samples were sequenced using both single-cell and single-nuclei suspensions so are included in the count for both "Single-cell" and "Single-nuclei" groups.
Samples that were sequenced with either bulk RNA-seq or spatial transcriptomics and do not have accompanying single-cell or single-nuclei RNA-seq data are not represented in the total counts.

C. Example of a project card as displayed on the "Browse" page of the ScPCA Portal and a "Visualize" view for a library within that project, colored by consensus cell type annotation..
This project card and visualized sample are from project `SCPCP000004` [@doi:10.1101/2024.01.07.574538; @doi:10.1186/s13059-024-03309-4].
Project cards include information about the number of samples, technologies and modalities, additional sample metadata information, submitter-provided diagnoses, and a submitter-provided abstract.
Where available, submitter-provided citation information, as well as other databases where this data has been deposited, are also provided.
The visualization employs the UCSC Cell Browser [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btab503], which allows interactive exploration of the UMAP embeddings for each cell, with user-selectable coloring options that include cell types, gene-level expression, and other per-cell annotations created by the `scpca-nf` workflow.

![**Overview of the `scpca-nf` workflow.**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexsLemonade/scpca-paper-figures/v0.1.1/figures/compiled_figures/pngs/figure_2.png?sanitize=true){#fig:fig2 tag="2" width="7in"}

A. Overview of `scpca-nf`, the primary workflow for processing single-cell and single-nuclei RNA-seq data for the ScPCA Portal.
Mapping is first performed with `alevin-fry` to generate a gene-by-cell count matrix, which is read into `R` and converted into a `SingleCellExperiment` (`SCE`) object.
This `SCE` object is exported as the `Unfiltered SCE Object` before further post-processing.
Next, empty droplets are filtered out, and the resulting `SCE` is exported as the `Filtered SCE Object`.
The filtered object undergoes additional post-processing, including removing low-quality cells, normalizing counts, and performing dimension reduction with principal components analysis and UMAP.
The object undergoes cell type annotation and CNV inference and is exported as the `Processed SCE Object`.
A summary QC report and a supplemental cell type report are prepared and exported.
Finally, all `SCE` files are converted to `AnnData` format and exported.

Panels B-G show example figures that appear in the summary QC report, shown here for `SCPCL000001` [@doi:10.1093/neuonc/noad207], as follows:

B. The total UMI count for each cell in the `Unfiltered SCE Object`, ordered by rank.
Points are colored by the percentage of cells that pass the empty droplets filter.

C. The number of genes detected in each cell passing the empty droplets filter against the total UMI count.
Points are colored by the percentage of mitochondrial reads in the cell.

D. `miQC` model diagnostic plot showing the percent of mitochondrial reads in each cell against the number of genes detected in the `Filtered SCE Object`.
Points are colored by the probability that the cell is compromised as determined by `miQC`.

E. The percent of mitochondrial reads in each cell against the number of genes detected in each cell.
Points are colored by whether the cell was kept or removed, as determined by both `miQC` and a minimum unique gene count cutoff, prior to normalization and dimensionality reduction.

F. UMAP embeddings of log-normalized RNA expression values where each cell is colored by the number of genes detected.

G. UMAP embeddings of log-normalized RNA expression values for the top four most variable genes, colored by the given gene's expression.
In the actual summary QC report, the top 12 most highly variable genes are shown.

H. File download structure for an ScPCA Portal project download in `SingleCellExperiment` (`SCE`) format.
The download folder is named according to the project ID, data format, and the date it was downloaded.
Download folders contain a folder for all single-cell data, `_single-cell`.
This folder contains a folder for each sample ID, each containing the three versions (unfiltered, filtered, and processed) of the expression data as well as the summary QC report and cell type report all named according to the ScPCA library ID.
The `single-cell_metadata.tsv` file contains sample metadata for all samples included in the download.
The `README.md` file provides information about the contents of each download file, additional contact and citation information, and terms of use for data downloaded from the ScPCA Portal.
The folder `_bulk` is only present for projects that also have bulk RNA-Seq data.
It contains a gene-by-sample matrix of raw gene expression as quantified by `salmon` and associated metadata for all samples with bulk RNA-Seq data.

I. File download structure for an ScPCA Portal merged project download in `SCE` format.
The download folder is named according to the project ID, data format, and the date it was downloaded.
Download folders contain a folder for all single-cell data, `_single-cell_merged`.
This folder contains a single merged object containing all samples in the given project and a summary report briefly detailing the contents of the merged object.
All summary QC and cell type reports for each individual library are also provided in the `individual_reports` folder arranged by their sample ID.
As in panel (H), additional files `single-cell_metadata.tsv`, `_bulk_quant.tsv`, `_bulk_metadata.tsv`, and `README.md` are also included.

A. Expanded view of the process for adding cell type annotations within `scpca-nf`, as introduced in Figure {@fig:fig2}A.
Cell type annotation is performed on the `Processed SCE Object`.
A `celldex` [@doi:10.1038/s41590-018-0276-y] reference dataset with ontology labels is used as input for annotation with `SingleR` [@doi:10.1038/s41590-018-0276-y], a list of marker genes compiled from `PanglaoDB` [@doi:10.1093/database/baz046] is used as input for annotation with `CellAssign` [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0529-1], and the `SCimilarity` foundation model is used as input for annotation with `SCimilarity` [@doi:10.1038/s41586-024-08411-y].
Results from these automated cell type annotation methods and a consensus cell type annotation are then added to the `Processed SCE Object`.
A cell type summary report with information about reference sources, comparisons among cell type annotation methods, and diagnostic plots is created.
Although not shown in this panel, cell type annotations are also included in the `Processed AnnData Object` created from the `Processed SCE Object` (Figure {@fig:fig2}A).

A. Dot plot showing expression of cell-type-specific marker genes across all libraries from brain and central nervous system (CNS) tumors, excluding multiplexed libraries.
Expression is shown for each broad cell type annotation, where each broad cell type annotation is a collection of similar consensus cell type annotations.
The y-axis displays the broad consensus cell type observed across libraries, with the total number of cells indicated in parentheses.
The x-axis displays marker genes, determined by `CellMarker2.0` [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkac947], used for consensus cell type validation for each cell type shown along the top annotation bar.
Dots are colored by mean gene expression across libraries and sized proportionally to the percent of libraries they are observed in, out of all cells with the same broad cell type annotation in brain and CNS tumor libraries.
A maximum of 10 cell type marker genes are shown for each broad cell type annotation.

B. Barplot showing the percentage of each broad consensus cell type annotation across libraries of brain and CNS tumors, separated into high-grade (left panel) and low-grade (right panel) glioma diagnoses for non-multiplexed libraries.

C. Barplot showing all consensus cell types classified as immune cells across libraries of brain and CNS tumors, separated into high-grade (left panel) and low-grade (right panel) glioma diagnoses for non-multiplexed libraries.
The percentage shown corresponds to the percentage of immune cells classified as the indicated consensus cell type.
Only libraries comprised of at least 1\% immune cells, based on consensus cell type annotations, are shown.
Specific consensus cell types for myeloid and lymphocyte immune cells are shown, with all other consensus immune cell types included in "other."
Notably, granulocytes are also included in "other" because only 1 granulocyte was present in all libraries shown (specifically, `SCPCL000793`).

A. Scatter plots colored by point density of `DESeq2`-transformed and normalized bulk RNA-seq expression compared to pseudobulk expression from single-cell/nuclei RNA-seq.
Samples with RNA-seq for both bulk and single-cell/nuclei modalities, excluding multiplexed samples, from ScPCA projects comprising brain and central nervous system tumors are shown, with the number of samples considered per project shown in parentheses.
The regression line is also shown for each project.
Results from additional projects are shown in Figure {@fig:figS7}A.

B. Odds ratios from overrepresentation analysis for the same samples shown in panel A, colored by FDR-corrected significance.
Each odds ratio represents the odds that marker genes for the given cell type were overrepresented in bulk RNA-seq when compared to single-cell/nuclei RNA-seq, relative to other genes.
A total of 36 consensus cell types were evaluated for each project shown here.
Results from additional projects are shown in Figure {@fig:figS7}B.

![**Results from benchmarking `alevin-fry` and `CellRanger` performance.**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexsLemonade/scpca-paper-figures/v0.1.1/figures/compiled_figures/pngs/figure_s1.png?sanitize=true){#fig:figS1 tag="S1" width="7in"}

Each panel compares metrics for six ScPCA libraries, including three single-cell and three single-nuclei suspensions, obtained from processing libraries with `salmon alevin` and `alevin-fry` or `CellRanger`.
Results shown were generated with `CellRanger v6.1.2` using default parameters for single-cell libraries and use of the `--include_introns` flag to include intronic reads for single-nuclei libraries only.
All libraries were processed with `salmon alevin v1.5.2` and `alevin-fry v0.4.1` using an index containing both spliced and unspliced cDNA as mentioned in the Methods.
The libraries used for benchmarking were randomly chosen.


A. Runtime in minutes (top row) and peak memory in GB (bottom row) for six ScPCA libraries processed with `alevin-fry` and `CellRanger`.
Processing with `alevin-fry` was consistently faster and more memory-efficient compared to processing with `CellRanger`.

Panels B-D show only cells present in both the `alevin-fry` and `CellRanger` output.

B. Comparison of mean gene expression values for six ScPCA libraries processed with `alevin-fry` and `CellRanger`, shown on a log-scale.
Each point is a gene, and only genes detected in at least 5 cells are shown.
$R^2$ values shown in the top left corner of each panel reflect broad agreement in mean gene expression values between platforms.

C. Comparison of log total UMI counts for six ScPCA libraries processed with `alevin-fry` and `CellRanger`.
Distributions reflect broad agreement in the total UMI count per cell between platforms, although `alevin-fry` returned slightly higher values for certain single-cell libraries.

D. Comparison of log total genes detected per cell for six ScPCA libraries processed with `alevin-fry` and `CellRanger`.
Distributions reflect broad agreement between platforms in the total number of genes detected per cell between platforms, although `alevin-fry` returned slightly higher values for certain single-cell libraries.

![**Processing additional single-cell modalities in `scpca-nf`.**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexsLemonade/scpca-paper-figures/v0.1.1/figures/compiled_figures/pngs/figure_s2.png?sanitize=true){#fig:figS2 tag="S2" width="7in"}

A. Overview of the `scpca-nf` workflow for processing libraries with CITE-seq or antibody-derived tag (ADT) data.
The workflow mirrors that shown in Figure {@fig:fig2}A with several differences accounting for the presence of ADT data.
First, both an RNA and ADT FASTQ file are required as input to `alevin-fry`, along with a TSV file containing information about ADT barcodes.
The gene-by-cell and ADT-by-cell count matrices are produced and read into `R` to create a `SingleCellExperiment` (SCE) object.
Second, during post-processing, statistics are calculated to filter cells based on ADT counts, but the filter is not applied.
ADT counts are also normalized and included in the `Processed SCE Object`.
Third, the summary QC report will include a `CITE-seq` section with additional information about ADT-level processing.
Fourth, the workflow exports `SCE` objects containing both RNA and ADT results, while separate `AnnData` objects for RNA and ADT are exported.

Panels B-D show example figures that appear in the CITE-seq section of the summary QC report, shown here for `SCPCL000290`.

B. The percent of mitochondrial reads in each cell against the number of genes detected in each cell.
The panel labeled "Keep" displays cells that are retained based on both RNA and ADT counts.
The panel labeled "Filter (ADT only)" displays cells that are filtered based on only ADT counts.
The panel labeled "Filter (RNA only)" displays cells that are filtered based on only RNA counts.
The panel labeled "Filter (RNA & ADT)" panel displays cells that are filtered based on both RNA and ADT counts.

C. Density plots of the log-normalized ADT counts shown for the four most variable ADTs in the library.

D. UMAP embeddings of log-normalized RNA expression values where each cell is colored by the expression of the given highly-variable ADT.

E. Overview of the `scpca-nf` workflow for multiplexed libraries.
The workflow mirrors that shown in Figure {@fig:fig2}A with several differences accounting for the presence of multiplexed data.
First, both an RNA and HTO FASTQ file are required as input to `alevin-fry`, along with a TSV file providing information about library pools.
The gene-by-cell and HTO-by-cell count matrices are produced and read into `R` to create a `SingleCellExperiment` (SCE) object.
Second, in parallel, the RNA FASTQ file, the HTO FASTQ file, and, if available, a corresponding Bulk RNA FASTQ file for each sample present in the multiplexed library are provided to a demultiplexing subprocess.
The workflow calculates demultiplexing results based on HTO counts, as well as genetic demultiplexing results if the library has corresponding bulk RNA FASTQ files.
Demultiplexing results are stored in all exported `SCE` objects (`Unfiltered`, `Filtered`, and `Processed`), but libraries themselves are not demultiplexed.
Third, only `SCE` files are provided for multiplexed libraries; no corresponding `AnnData` files are provided.

A. Overview of the bulk RNA-Seq workflow.
A set of FASTQ files from libraries sequenced with bulk RNA-seq are provided as input.
Reads are trimmed using `fastp`, and `salmon` is used to map reads and quantify counts.
The quantified gene expression files output from `salmon` are then grouped by ScPCA Project ID, and a sample-by-gene count matrix is exported for each Project in TSV format.

B. Overview of the spatial transcriptomics workflow.
The FASTQ file and tissue image for a given library are provided as input to `spaceranger`.
The workflow directly returns the results from running `spaceranger` without any further processing.

C. Overview of the merged workflow.
Processed `SCE` objects associated with a given project are merged into a single object, including ADT counts from CITE-seq data if present, and a merged summary report is generated.
Merged objects are available for download either in `SCE` or `AnnData` format.

D. Example of UMAPs as shown in the merged summary report.
A grid of UMAPs is shown for each library in the merged object, with cells in the library of interest shown in red and cells belonging to other libraries shown in gray.
The UMAP is constructed from the merged object such that all libraries contribute an equal weight, but no batch correction was performed.
The libraries pictured are a subset of libraries in the ScPCA project `SCPCP000003`.
For this figure specifically, the merged UMAP was constructed from a merged object containing only these four libraries, but the merged object and summary report on the ScPCA Portal for `SCPCP000003` contain all of this project's libraries.

`SingleR` was used to annotate ScPCA libraries using four different human-specific references from the `celldex` package.
Libraries represent three different diagnosis groups in the ScPCA Portal - Brain and CNS, Leukemia, and Sarcoma -  as indicated in the labels for the individual panels.
The distribution of the delta median statistic, calculated for each cell by subtracting the median delta score from the score of the annotated cell type label, is shown on the y-axis, while the `celldex` reference used is shown on the x-axis.
Higher values indicate a higher quality cell type annotation, although there is no absolute scale for these values.
Each black point represents a cell, where closed circles denote cells with high-quality annotations and open circles denote cells with low-quality annotations, as assessed by `SingleR`.
Red diamonds represent the median delta median score for all cells with high-quality annotations in that library.

Dot plots showing expression of cell-type-specific marker genes across all libraries from Leukemia (A), Sarcoma (B), and Other solid tumors (C) diagnosis groups.
Expression is shown for each broad cell type annotation, where each broad cell type annotation is a collection of similar consensus cell type annotations.
The y-axis displays the broad consensus cell type observed across libraries, with the total number of cells indicated in parentheses.
The x-axis displays marker genes, determined by `CellMarker2.0` [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkac947], used for consensus cell type validation for each cell type shown along the top annotation bar.
Dots are colored by mean gene expression across libraries and sized proportionally to the percent of libraries they are observed in, out of all cells with the same broad cell type annotation in the given diagnosis.

A. Scatter plots colored by point density of `DESeq2`-transformed and normalized bulk RNA-seq expression compared to pseudobulk expression from single-nuclei RNA-seq.
Projects with RNA-seq for both bulk and single-cell/nuclei modalities that are not displayed in Figure {@fig:fig6}A are shown.
All samples shown here are single-nuclei, and the number of samples considered per project is shown in parentheses.
The regression line is also shown for each project.

B. Odds ratios from overrepresentation analysis for the same samples shown in panel A, colored by FDR-corrected significance.
Each odds ratio represents the odds that marker genes for the given cell type were overrepresented in the bulk modality, relative to other genes.
31 consensus cell types were evaluated for project `SCPCP000006`, and 37 consensus cell types were evaluated for project `SCPCP000017`.
