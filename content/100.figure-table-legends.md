A. Barplots showing sample counts across four main cancer groupings in the ScPCA Portal, with each bar displaying the number of samples for each cancer type.
Each bar is shaded based on the number of samples with each disease timing, and total sample counts for each cancer type are shown to the right of each bar.
B. Barplot showing sample counts across types of modalities present in the ScPCA Portal.
All samples in the portal are shown under the "All Samples" heading.
Samples under the "Samples with additional modalities" heading represent a subset of the total samples with the given additional modality.
Colors shown for each additional modality indicate the suspension type that the single-cell or single-nuclei sample is associated with.
For example, 75 single-cell samples and 43 single-nuclei samples have accompanying Bulk RNA-seq data.
C. Example of a project card as displayed on the "Browse" page of the ScPCA Portal.
This project card is associated with project `SCPCP000009`.
Project cards include information about the number of samples, technologies and modalities, additional sample metadata information, submitter-provided diagnoses, as well as submitter-provided abstract.
Where available, submitter-provided citation information as well as other databases where this data has been deposited are also provided.
