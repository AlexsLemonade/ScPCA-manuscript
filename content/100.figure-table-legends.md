A. Barplots showing sample counts across four main cancer groupings in the ScPCA Portal, with each bar displaying the number of samples for each cancer type.
Each bar is shaded based on the number of samples with each disease timing, and total sample counts for each cancer type are shown to the right of each bar.

B. Barplot showing sample counts across types of modalities present in the ScPCA Portal.
All samples in the portal are shown under the "All Samples" heading.
Samples under the "Samples with additional modalities" heading represent a subset of the total samples with the given additional modality.
Colors shown for each additional modality indicate the suspension type used, either single-cell or single-nuclei RNA-seq.
For example, 75 single-cell samples and 43 single-nuclei samples have accompanying Bulk RNA-seq data.

C. Example of a project card as displayed on the "Browse" page of the ScPCA Portal.
This project card is associated with project `SCPCP000009` [@doi:10.21203/rs.3.rs-2517703/v1; @doi:10.21203/rs.3.rs-2517758/v1].

![**Overview of the `scpca-nf` workflow.**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexsLemonade/scpca-paper-figures/main/figures/compiled_figures/pngs/figure_2.png?sanitize=true){#fig:fig2 tag="2" width="7in"}

A. Overview of `scpca-nf`, the primary workflow for processing single-cell and single-nuclei RNA-seq data for the ScPCA Portal.
Mapping is first performed with `alevin-fry` to generate a gene by cell count matrix, which is read into `R` and converted into a `SingleCellExperiment` (`SCE`) object.
This `SCE` object is exported as the `Unfiltered SCE Object` before further post-processing.
Next, empty droplets are filtered out, and the resulting `SCE` is exported as the `Filtered SCE Object`.
The filtered object undergoes additional post-processing, including removing low-quality cells, normalizing counts, and performing dimension reduction including principal components analysis and UMAP calculation.
The object undergoes cell type annotation and is exported as the `Processed SCE Object`.
A summary QC report and a supplemental cell type report are prepared and exported.
Finally, all `SCE` files are converted to `AnnData` format and exported.
Panels B-G show example figures that appear in the summary QC report, shown here for `SCPCL000001`, as follows [@doi:10.1093/neuonc/noad207].

B. The total UMI count for each cell in the `Unfiltered SCE Object`, ordered by rank.
Points are colored by the percentage of cells that pass the empty droplets filter.

C. The number of genes detected in each cell passing the empty droplets filter against the total UMI count.
Points are colored by the percentage of mitochondrial reads in the cell.

D. `miQC` model diagnostic plot showing the percent of mitochondrial reads in each cell against the number of genes detected in the `Filtered SCE Object`.
Points are colored by the probability that the cell is compromised as determined by `miQC`.

E. The percent of mitochondrial reads in each cell against the number of genes detected in each cell.
Points are colored by whether the cell was kept or removed, as determined by both `miQC` and a minimum unique gene count cutoff, prior to normalization and dimensionality reduction.

F. UMAP embeddings of log-normalized RNA expression values where each cell is colored by the number of genes detected.

G. UMAP embeddings of log-normalized RNA expression values for the top four most variable genes, colored by the given gene's expression.
In the actual summary QC report, the top 12 most highly variable genes are shown.

![**ScPCA Portal project download file structure and merged object workflow.**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexsLemonade/scpca-paper-figures/main/figures/compiled_figures/pngs/figure_3.png?sanitize=true){#fig:fig3 tag="3" width="7in"}

A. File download structure for an ScPCA Portal project download in `SingleCellExperiment` (`SCE`) format.
The download folder is named according to both the project ID and the date it was downloaded.
Download folders contain one folder for each sample ID, each containing the three versions (unfiltered, filtered, and processed) of the expression data as well as the summary QC report and cell type report all named according to the ScPCA library ID.
The `single_cell_metadata.tsv` file contains sample metadata for all samples included in the download.
The `README.md` file provides information about the contents of each download file, additional contact and citation information, and terms of use for data downloaded from the ScPCA Portal.
The files `bulk_quant.tsv` and `bulk_metadata.tsv` are only present for projects that also have bulk RNA-Seq data and contain, respectively, a gene by sample matrix of raw gene expression as quantified by `salmon`, and associated metadata for all samples with bulk RNA-Seq data.

B. File download structure for an ScPCA Portal merged project download in `SCE` format.
The download folder is named according to both the project ID and the date it was downloaded.
Download folders contain a single merged object containing all samples in the given project as well as a summary report briefly detailing the contents of the merged object.
All summary QC and cell type reports for each individual library are also provided in the `individual_reports` folder arranged by their sample ID.
As in panel (A), additional files `single_cell_metadata.tsv`, `bulk_quant.tsv`, `bulk_metadata.tsv`, and `README.md` are also included.

C. Overview of the merged workflow.
Processed `SCE` objects associated with a given project are merged into a single object, including ADT counts from CITE-seq data if present, and a merged summary report is generated.
Merged objects are available for download either in `SCE` or `AnnData` format.

D. Example of UMAPs as shown in the merged summary report.
A grid of UMAPs is shown for each library in the merged object, with cells in the library of interest shown in red and all other cells belonging to other libraries shown in gray.
The UMAP is constructed from the merged object such that all libraries contribute an equal weight, but no batch correction was performed.
The libraries pictured are a subset of libraries in the ScPCA project `SCPCP000003`.

![**Cell type annotation in `scpca-nf`.**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexsLemonade/scpca-paper-figures/main/figures/compiled_figures/pngs/figure_4.png?sanitize=true){#fig:fig4 tag="4" width="7in"}

A. Expanded view of the process for adding cell type annotations within `scpca-nf`, as introduced in Figure {@fig:fig2}A.
Cell type annotation is performed on the `Processed SCE Object`.
A `celldex` [@doi:10.1038/s41590-018-0276-y] reference dataset with ontology labels is used as input for annotation with `SingleR` [@doi:10.1038/s41590-018-0276-y], and a list of marker genes compiled from `PanglaoDB` [@doi:10.1093/database/baz046] is used as input for annotation with `CellAssign` [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0529-1].
Results from cell type annotation are then added to the `Processed SCE Object`, and a cell type summary report with information about reference sources, comparisons among cell type annotation methods, and diagnostic plots is created.
Although not shown in this panel, cell type annotations are also included in the `Processed AnnData Object` created from the `Processed SCE Object` (Figure {@fig:fig2}A).

B. Example heatmap as shown in the cell type summary report comparing annotations with `SingleR` and `CellAssign`.
Heatmap cells are colored by the Jaccard similarity index.
A value of 1 means that there is complete overlap between which cells are annotated with the two labels being compared, and a value of 0 means that there is no overlap between which cells are annotated with the two labels being compared.
The heatmap shown is from library `SCPCL000498` [@doi:10.1016/j.devcel.2022.04.003].

![**Results from benchmarking `alevin-fry` and `CellRanger` performance.**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexsLemonade/scpca-paper-figures/main/figures/compiled_figures/pngs/figure_s1.png?sanitize=true){#fig:figS1 tag="S1" width="7in"}

Each panel compares metrics for six representative ScPCA libraries, including three single-cell and three single-nuclei suspensions, obtained from processing libraries with both `alevin-fry` and `CellRanger`.

A. Runtime in minutes (top row) and peak memory in GB (bottom row) for six ScPCA libraries processed with `alevin-fry` and `CellRanger`.
Processing with `alevin-fry` was consistently faster and more memory-efficient compared to processing with `CellRanger`.

Panels B-D show only cells present in both the `alevin-fry` and `CellRanger` output.

B. Comparison of mean gene expression values for six ScPCA libraries processed with `alevin-fry` and `CellRanger`, shown on a log-scale.
Each point is a gene, and only genes detected in at least 5 cells are shown.
$R^2$ values shown in the top left corner of each panel reflect broad agreement in mean gene expression values between platforms.

C. Comparison of log total UMI counts for six ScPCA libraries processed with `alevin-fry` and `CellRanger`.
Distributions reflect broad agreement in the total UMI count per cell between platforms, although `alevin-fry` returned slightly higher values for certain single-cell libraries.

D. Comparison of log total genes detected per cell for six ScPCA libraries processed with `alevin-fry` and `CellRanger`.
Distributions reflect broad agreement between platforms in the total number of genes detected per cell between platforms, although `alevin-fry` returned slightly higher values for certain single-cell libraries.

![**Processing additional single-cell modalities in `scpca-nf`.**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexsLemonade/scpca-paper-figures/main/figures/compiled_figures/pngs/figure_s2.png?sanitize=true){#fig:figS2 tag="S2" width="7in"}

A. Overview of the `scpca-nf` workflow for processing libraries with CITE-seq or antibody-derived tag (ADT) derived data.
The workflow mirrors that shown in Figure {@fig:fig2}A with several differences accounting for the presence of ADT data.
First, both an RNA and ADT FASTQ file are required as input to `alevin-fry`, along with a TSV file containing information about ADT barcodes.
The gene by cell and ADT by cell count matrices are produced and read into `R` to create a `SingleCellExperiment` (SCE) object.
Second, during post-processing, statistics are calculated to filter cells based on ADT counts, but the filter is not applied.
ADT counts are also normalized and included in the `Processed SCE Object`.
Third, the summary QC report will include a `CITE-seq` section with additional information about ADT-level processing.
Fourth, the workflow exports `SCE` objects containing both RNA and ADT results, while separate `AnnData` objects for RNA and ADT are exported.

Panels B-D show example figures that appear in the CITE-seq section of the summary QC report, shown here for `SCPCL000290`.

B. The percent of mitochondrial reads in each cell against the number of genes detected in each cell.
The panel labeled "Keep" displays cells that are retained based on both RNA and ADT counts.
The panel labeled "Filter (ADT only)" displays cells that are filtered based on only ADT counts.
The panel labeled "Filter (RNA only)" displays cells that are filtered based on only RNA counts.
The panel labeled "Filter (RNA & ADT)" panel displays cells that are filtered based on both RNA and ADT counts.

C. Density plots of the log-normalized ADT counts shown for the four most variable ADTs in the library.

D. UMAP embeddings of log-normalized RNA expression values where each cell is colored by the expression of the given highly-variable ADT.

E. Overview of the `scpca-nf` workflow for multiplexed libraries.
The workflow mirrors that shown in Figure {@fig:fig2}A with several differences accounting for the presence of multiplexed data.
First, both an RNA and HTO FASTQ file are required as input to `alevin-fry`, along with a TSV file providing information about library pools.
The gene by cell and HTO by cell count matrices are produced and read into `R` to create a `SingleCellExperiment` (SCE) object.
Second, in parallel, the RNA FASTQ file, the HTO FASTQ file, and, if available, a corresponding Bulk RNA FASTQ file for each sample present in the multiplexed library are provided to a demultiplexing subprocess.
The workflow calculates demultiplexing results based on HTO counts, as well as genetic demultiplexing results if the library has corresponding bulk RNA FASTQ files.
Demultiplexing results are stored in all exported `SCE` objects (`Unfiltered`, `Filtered`, and `Processed`), but libraries themselves are not demultiplexed.
Third, only `SCE` files are provided for multiplexed libraries; no corresponding `AnnData` files are provided.

![**Processing other sequencing modalities with `scpca-nf`.**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexsLemonade/scpca-paper-figures/main/figures/compiled_figures/pngs/figure_s3.png?sanitize=true){#fig:figS3 tag="S3" width="7in"}

A. Overview of the bulk RNA-Seq workflow.
A set of FASTQ files from libraries sequenced with bulk RNA-seq are provided as input.
Reads are trimmed using `fastp`, and `salmon` is used to map reads and quantify counts.
The quantified gene expression files output from `salmon` are then grouped by ScPCA Project ID, and a sample by gene count matrix is exported for each Project in TSV format.

B. Overview of the spatial transcriptomics workflow.
The FASTQ file and tissue image for a given library are provided as input to `spaceranger`.
The workflow directly returns the results from running `spaceranger` without any further processing.

<!--Figure S4-->
![**Evaluation of references available in the celldex package for use with SingleR.**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexsLemonade/scpca-paper-figures/main/figures/compiled_figures/pngs/figure_s4.png?sanitize=true){#fig:figS4 tag="S4" width="7in"}

`SingleR` was used to annotate ScPCA libraries using four different human-specific references from the `celldex` package.
Libraries represent three different diagnosis groups in the ScPCA Portal - Brain and CNS, Leukemia, and Sarcoma -  as indicated in the labels for the individual panels.
The distribution of the delta median statistic, calculated for each cell by subtracting the median delta score from the score of the annotated cell type label, is shown on the y-axis, while the `celldex` reference used is shown on the x-axis.
Higher values indicate a higher quality cell type annotation, although there is no absolute scale for these values.
Each black point represents a cell, where closed circles denote cells with high-quality annotations and open circles denote cells with low-quality annotations, as assessed by `SingleR`.
Red diamonds represent the median delta median score for all cells with high-quality annotations in that library.
<br><br>

<!--Figure S5-->
![**Cell type annotation with `CellAssign`.**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexsLemonade/scpca-paper-figures/main/figures/compiled_figures/pngs/figure_s5.png?sanitize=true){#fig:figS5 tag="S5" width="7in"}

Both plots in this figure are examples of plots that display results from annotating cells with `CellAssign` that can be found in the cell type summary report, shown here for library `SCPCL000490`[@doi:10.1016/j.devcel.2022.04.003].

A. A grid of UMAPs is shown for each cell type annotated using `CellAssign`, with the cell type of interest shown in color and all other cells belonging to other cell types shown in gray.
The top four cell types with the greatest number of assigned cells are shown, while all other cells are grouped together and labeled with `All remaining cell types`.
Any cells that are unable to be assigned by `CellAssign` are labeled with `Unknown cell type`.

B. This example heatmap displays a comparison between submitter-provided annotations and annotations with `CellAssign`, where heatmap cells are colored by the Jaccard similarity index.
A value of 1 means that there is complete overlap between which cells are annotated with the two labels being compared, and a value of 0 means that there is no overlap between which cells are annotated with the two labels being compared.
<br><br>

<!-- Figure S6 -->
![**Assessment of cell type annotation quality.**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexsLemonade/scpca-paper-figures/main/figures/compiled_figures/pngs/figure_s6.png?sanitize=true){#fig:figS6 tag="S6" width="7in"}

Both plots in this figure are examples of diagnostic plots in the cell type summary report, shown for library `SCPCL000001` [@doi:10.1093/neuonc/noad207].

A. Diagnostic plot showing `SingleR` cell type annotation quality.
Cell type annotations are shown on the y-axis, the delta median statistic is shown on the x-axis.
The delta median statistic is calculated for each cell as the difference between the `SingleR` score of the annotated cell type label and the median score of all other cell type labels in the reference dataset.
Higher values indicate a higher quality cell type annotation, although there is no absolute scale for these values.
Each black point represents a cell, where closed circles denote cells with high-quality annotations and open circles denote cells with low-quality annotations, as assessed by `SingleR`.
Red diamonds represent the median delta median scores for all cells with high-quality annotations associated with the given cell type label.

B. Diagnostic plot showing `CellAssign` cell type annotation quality.
Cell type annotations are shown on the y-axis, and the probability of the annotated cell type as calculated by `CellAssign` is shown on the x-axis.
Each row displays probabilities for only the cells associated with the given cell type annotation, and blue line segments show the probabilities for individual cells in each distribution.
Taller line segments are shown for any distribution with five or fewer cells.
<br><br>

<!-- Figure S7 -->
![**Comparison of cell type annotations across methods.**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexsLemonade/scpca-paper-figures/main/figures/compiled_figures/pngs/figure_s7.png?sanitize=true){#fig:figS7 tag="S7" width="7in"}

This example heatmap from the cell type summary report compares submitter-provided annotations to annotations with `SingleR` and `CellAssign`, shown for library `SCPCL000498` [@doi:10.1016/j.devcel.2022.04.003].
This heatmap is only shown in the cell type summary report if submitters provided cell type annotations.
Heatmap cells are colored by the Jaccard similarity index.
A value of 1 means that there is complete overlap between which cells are annotated with the two labels being compared, and a value of 0 means that there is no overlap between which cells are annotated with the two labels being compared.
